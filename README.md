# DeepFake Generation

This repository contains tools and models for deepfake generation, using advanced deep learning techniques to create realistic face swaps and manipulations in images and videos.

## Overview

DeepFake Generation is a comprehensive toolkit that implements state-of-the-art deepfake generation algorithms. It includes pipelines for face detection, alignment, swapping, and post-processing to create high-quality synthetic media.

## Features

- **Face Detection & Alignment**: Robust detection and alignment of facial landmarks for preprocessing
- **Multiple Model Architectures**: Implementations of various deepfake generation models, including:
  - GAN-based face swapping
  - Autoencoder architectures
- **Training Pipeline**: Complete workflow for training custom models on your own datasets
- **Inference Tools**: Optimized code for generating deepfakes from pretrained models
- **Quality Enhancement**: Post-processing techniques to improve realism and consistency
